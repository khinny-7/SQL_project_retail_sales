## Project Overview


## Objectives

- Build a Retail Sales Database: Create a database and import the sales dataset into it.
- Clean the Data: Check for missing or null values and remove incomplete records.
- Explore the Data: Run initial analysis to better understand patterns within the dataset.
- Analyze Business Questions: Use SQL queries to answer real business questions and extract meaningful insights.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- Create Database: A database called p1_retail_db is created to store all project data.
- Create Table: A table named retail_sales is built to hold the sales records, including details

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The SQL queries were developed to answer the following business questions:

- Retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05.

- Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022.

- Calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.

- Find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.

- Find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.

- Find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.

- Calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year.

- Find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales.

- Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.

- Create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17).
